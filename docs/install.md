# Install

**tl;dr**: [Download WSK](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/latest) and run `$ npm install --global gulp && npm install` in that directory to get started.

To take advantage of Web Starter Kit you need to:

1. Get a copy of the code.
2. Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3. Modify the application to your liking.
4. Deploy your production code.

## Getting the code

[Download](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/latest) and extract WSK to where you want to work.

## Prerequisites

### [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Bring up a terminal and type `node --version`.
Node should respond with a version at or above 0.10.x.
If you require Node, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

### [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)

Bring up a terminal and type `gulp --version`.
If Gulp is installed it should return a version number at or above 3.9.x.
If you need to install/upgrade Gulp, open up a terminal and type in the following:

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

*This will install Gulp globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to [configure your system](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md) to install packages globally without administrative privileges.*


### Local dependencies

Next, install the local dependencies Web Starter Kit requires:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Note: if you have the [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager installed, you can just run `yarn`.
Web Starter Kit includes a yarn.lock file that will be used here.

That's it! You should now have everything needed to use the Web Starter Kit.

You may also want to get used to some of the [commands](commands.md) available.
