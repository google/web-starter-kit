# Deploy to Google App Engine

Google App Engine lets you build and run applications on Googleâ€™s infrastructure. App Engine applications are easy to create, easy to maintain, and easy to scale as your traffic and data storage needs change. 

## Create the project in the Developer Console

In [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project):

1. Create a new project
2. Take note of the project ID (e.g `algebraic-depot-114712`)

## Install Google Cloud SDK

See <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/>.

## Download source code

Download and extract [Web Starter Kit](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/releases/latest) to a local directory.

Create a new file in the root of your project called `app.yaml`. Paste the following contents into it:

```
application: algebraic-depot-114712
version: 0
runtime: php55
api_version: 1
threadsafe: false

handlers:
- url: /$
  static_files: index.html
  upload: index.html

- url: /(.*)
  static_files: \1
  upload: .*
```

This is a minimalist configuration for serving a Web Starter Kit project on App Engine. A more comprehensive one should you need it is available [here](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-gae/blob/master/app.yaml).

## Install web-starter-kit dependencies (e.g Node)

See <https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit/blob/master/docs/install.md>.

## Install local dependencies and generate assets

```
npm install
gulp 
````

## Deploy

````
cp app.yaml dist
cd dist
appcfg.py update . # "rm ~/.appcfg_oauth2_tokens" if error
````

If the update fails, check that your `application` in `app.yaml` matches the project id in the Developers Console.

If everything has worked, you will be able to see your fully deployed site at `<project ID>.appspot.com` (e.g `https://algebraic-depot-114712.appspot.com/`).
